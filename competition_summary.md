# Living Literature Review Agent

## Problem
Researchers, NGOs, and policy teams struggle to keep pace with rapidly expanding scientific literature. Existing tools produce static summaries, opaque outputs, or unranked evidence that is difficult to audit or trust.

## Solution
The Living Literature Review Agent is a reasoning-driven system that continuously evaluates, ranks, and synthesizes scientific literature with explicit methodological discipline.

The agent structures research questions, maps evidence across disciplines, ranks publications by relevance and rigor, and identifies gaps, uncertainty, and conflicting findings.

## Key Innovation
Unlike standard retrieval-based agents, this system:
- Explicitly classifies user intent
- Decomposes research questions into sub-questions
- Applies evidence scoring and ranking
- Maintains auditability without exposing chain-of-thought
- Supports expandable evidence disclosure (Top 10 → 50)

## Impact
- Accelerates high-quality literature reviews
- Improves evidence transparency in policy decisions
- Reduces risk of citation bias or hallucination
- Enables living, updateable reviews for evolving topics

## Intended Users
- PhD and postdoctoral researchers
- NGOs and policy research teams
- Grant writers and evidence synthesis units
