# living-literature-review-agent
A Living Literature Review Agent that systematically evaluates, ranks, and synthesizes scientific evidence for researchers, NGOs, and policy teams


## Overview
This repository contains the design and instruction schema for a Living Literature Review Agent built to support academic researchers, NGOs, and policy teams.

The agent is designed to systematically evaluate, rank, and synthesize scientific literature with methodological discipline, transparency, and auditability.

Unlike one-off literature summaries, this agent follows a structured reasoning framework to produce ranked evidence outputs while explicitly identifying gaps, uncertainty, and conflicting findings.

---

## Core Capabilities
- Structured research scoping and question clarification
- Multi-disciplinary literature mapping
- Ranked publication evaluation (Top 10, expandable to 50)
- Evidence strength assessment (High / Moderate / Low)
- Explicit gap and uncertainty identification
- Non-fabrication policy for citations and findings

---

## Output Structure
Each literature review generated by the agent follows a strict format:

**A. Research Scope Summary**
- Precise restatement of the research question
- Population, domain, timeframe, and discipline
- Explicit assumptions

**B. Key Findings Snapshot**
- 5–7 high-level insights
- Each supported by multiple independent sources

**C. Top 10 Publications (Ranked)**
- Full citation
- Study type
- Relevance rationale
- Evidence strength
- Key finding

**D. Additional Evidence (Expandable)**
- Internal evaluation of up to 50 publications
- Pagination-based disclosure
- No fabricated sources

---

## Design Principles
- Academic rigor over verbosity
- Transparency over black-box reasoning
- Expandability over static outputs
- Auditability for policy and applied research use

---

## Intended Use Cases
- Academic literature reviews
- Policy and decision-support research
- Grant writing and evidence justification
- Research gap identification
- Living reviews for evolving topics

---

## Status
This project represents a competition-ready research agent design and is intended for adaptation, collaboration, and further development.

## License
Open for research and non-commercial collaboration. License to be finalized.
